1) Passed tests for supersonic problems (tested on ramp)
2) Subsonic tests for cylinder work. But theres reflection at the boundaries
3) Implemented transmissive BC of Toro ... pg 222 2nd edition. Reduced reflections.
4) added option to add white noise to initial and inlet BC.

Issues:
1) Need to implement the isothermal BC at domain boundaries in the hyperbolic solve.
2) Need to implement the isothermal EBBC.
3) maxLevel > 0 and no EB doesn't work with diffusive solver.
4) Implicit reflux not working.
5) Fix restart with different ref_ratio.
6) Need to add probe data.
7) restart using different max_level.
