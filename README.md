This is a library to conduct global stability analysis of PDEs. 

It uses the Matrix-free Block Krylov Subspace method provided by Anasazi package to solve the resulting large scale eigenvalue problem. It can be easily integrated with existing C++ PDE solvers.

This repository also includes an example showing the computation of Eigenvalues of the incompressible Navier Stokes equations. 

The Navier Stokes solver is based on the Embeded Boundary solver developed using CHOMBO library (https://commons.lbl.gov/display/chombo/Chombo+-+Software+for+Adaptive+Solutions+of+Partial+Differential+Equations).
